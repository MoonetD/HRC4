# Thank you for Accessing my Project

I am sorry if the code is janky since this is my first website project. 

## After git cloning the file you should run code below in the VSCode

```sh
npm install
```

### To run the webpage locally on your device use the code below.
```sh
npm run dev
```
#### PS. I did not protect my API tokens, since it was too complicated for me. 
```sh
It will be great if you can ignore them when accessing! Thanks :)
```
